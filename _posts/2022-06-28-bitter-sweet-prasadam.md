## Symptoms of food poisoning

> The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. 
                                                     - WHO
<br>

After losing enough fluids from both your orifaces, your body will enter a state of dehydration, which is what can eventually lead to death unless treated. Which is why it is important to ==seek medical attention immediately!==

Repeated stomach infections can rob a child of the necessary nutrients and can lead to stunting which is evident in India.
Enteric infection can worsen malnutrition and lead to delay in schooling of children

The wrath of such stomach infections leads to long term cognitive and other metabolic disorders. This not only increases the cost of public health, but also the productivity of the citizen.

But why only prasadam, why not other gathers that cause food poisioning outbreaks one might ask, and my answer to them is that why not look at how hygenic marriages are in India?

Moving away from  marriages for a moment, how are we feeding the kids of India who's only source of a nutritious meal was supposed to come from mid-day meals scheme?

Pretty terrible as you can see. Next time you are at a marriage or a temple function, think twice before digging your hands in to the food. 😉
